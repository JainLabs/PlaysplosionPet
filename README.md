PlaySplosionPet
===============

Play with a virtual, talking pet. Web app made at AT&amp;T Autism Speaks April 2013 hackathon to ease sensory overload breakdowns and teach social skills.

This is part one of a two part application. Part two will make it up at some point in the future.

This pet uses Hammer.js based touch events to trigger animations and state changes for the pet. For example, a rub/pinch out gesture will trigger a tummy rub emotional response. This trigger based structure allows the pet to teach children social boundaries and helps to teach children the difference in harmful and beneficial actions.

A response trigger system sends voice prompts to the user to have them come back to interact with the pet - this causes children to pay more attention to the pet, like normal social interactions.
